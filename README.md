# Housing-Price-Prediction-Neural-Network-
a multi-layer perceptron neural network from scratch to solve a classification task predicting housing prices in the New York market.
Utilized computations, including ReLU activation, mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, backpropagation, and gradient checking for accurate label prediction.
Trained the model across ten different train/test splits with 1,500 data points each, achieving 80% accuracy.
